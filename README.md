A typing speed checking website.
Live demo : https://gbtyping.netlify.app/

Steps to Run:
1. Extract the project folder
2. just run "npm start" in the project directory.
3. The site will open.


Things considered/suggestions taken from friends while making this project:

1. Character comparison instead of words comparison.
        In word comparison, users will remember the keys for particular words.
    We can observe that the users can type the most used words quicker. It is general approach. 
    But when we compare each character, then they remember each key in the keyboard. 
    So, even when facing a new unknown word, they can type it fast.

2. Three lines should be visible to the user.
        One is previous line
        Second line is the currently typing line
        Third line is the next text line.
        
3. Interface should be simple.
